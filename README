# figma-metrics

This library aims to calculate usage of Figma components (coming from predetermined files) across all files of a Figma team. It will separate these statistics by projects and files in those projects.

In order for the script to work you need to set the following enviroment variables:

-   FIGMA-API-TOKEN
-   FIGMA-TEAM-ID
-   FIGMA_LIBRARY_FILES

For `FIGMA_LIBRARY_FILES` a comma separated list is expected.

## The stats

For each file the following stats are calculated:

-   The total number of nodes
-   The total number of component nodes
-   The total number of non component nodes
-   The percantage of component nodes out of all nodes
-   The percantage of non component nodes out of all nodes
-   An object of all detached components and how many times they were used
-   An object of all components that were used, how many times they were used and which library they come from
