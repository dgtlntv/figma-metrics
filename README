get all projects of team that have changed since last check

for each project
    const project = {projectName: project.name, projectId: project.id}

    for each file in project
        const nodes = get all nodes in file
        const readyForDevNodes = get all nodes in ready for dev sections

        find all components in nodes and readyForDevNodes
            disregard componets from the same file?
            take note of which library it comes from (add it to library counter)
            take note of which component it is (add it to component counter)
            check if it has overrides
                we might need to ignore some overrides tho

        find all detached components in nodes and readyForDevNodes (tracking pixel) (add it to detached counter)

        calculate source mix for nodes and readyForDevNodes

        add statistics for this file to project object
